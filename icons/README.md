# Icon Sets (working directory)

**Note:** This directory contains the graphic files for the icons used with the toolbar. They are created with AdobeÂ® Photoshop. The PNG icon sets included with the release package are in **/docs/icons/**.

The Icons are based on the [Eva Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/#/), published under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php). The original black and white icons were colored for this application by the maintainer.
