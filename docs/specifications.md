# novelibre specifications


## Requirements

*novelibre* has evolved from a yw7 file converter, whereby I first had to gain experience 
in user interface design and gradually refactored the program again and again. 
The requirements are now to be recorded subsequently in order to be able to generate 
test cases that are as complete as possible. 
The aim is to expand the system of automatic tests, and ensure the quality of 
the further development of *novelibre*.
