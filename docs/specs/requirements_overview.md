# Requirements overview

of them during creation and revision.

## Theme

*novelibre* is an add-on to OpenOffice or LibreOffice that helps to
break down large novels into parts, chapters and sections, all of which
are provided with additional information called metadata. The metadata
remain permanently associated with the chapters and sections in the ODT
manuscript throughout the work on the novel. *novelibre* makes
information about the story world accessible and and relates characters,
locations, and items to the sections. *novelibre* can hold information
about plot lines and plot points that are assigned to the sections.
