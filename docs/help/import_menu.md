# Import menu 

**Update the project from previously exported ODT documents**

This will open a pop-up window with a list containing previously exported ODT documents that can be re-imported, 
thus updating the current project. 

- The document types and dates are shown.
- Documents that are newer than the project file are highlighted in green.
- Documents that cannot be imported because they are open in LibreOffice/OpenOffice are highlighted in red.
- You can update the project from a document either by double-clicking on the list entry, 
  or by selecting the document and clicking on the **Import** button. 
- You can delete documents by selecting them and clicking on the **Discard** button. 
- After closing a listed document in LibreOffice while the *Exported documents* window is open, you can click on the **Refresh view** button. 
- If the **Discard document after import** checkbox is checked, a document will be deleted after re-import. This may help to avoid confusion about changes made with *noveltree* and OpenOffice/LibreOffice.
- **Note:** Documents with split sections are always automatically discarded after re-import.
