## Add

**Add a new project note**

You can add a project note to the tree with **Project notes > Add**.

- If a project note is selected, the new item is placed after the selected one.
- Otherwise, the new project note is placed at the first position.   
- The new project note has an auto-generated title. You can change it in the right pane.

## Show list

**Show an HTML report with project notes**

This will generate a list-formatted HTML file, and launch your system's web browser for displaying it. 

- The Report is a temporary file, auto-deleted on program exit.
- If needed, you can have your web browser save or print it.
