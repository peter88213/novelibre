<text:p text:style-name="Chapter_20_beginning">The arrangements for my meeting with Alpha had been carefully made by correspondence before he left England. He was to be at the Golden Lion Hotel at eleven o’clock on the night of the 15th of October. I reckoned to arrive in the town between eight and nine on the same evening, to proceed to another hotel, and, on pretence of taking a stroll, slip out and call on him at the appointed hour. I should then fulfil my commission, take his answer, and enjoy the rare pleasure of a long talk with him. Early the next morning he would have left Wintenberg, and I should be on my way back to Strelsau. I knew that he would not fail to keep his appointment, and I was perfectly confident of being able to carry out the programme punctually; I had, however, taken the precaution of obtaining a week’s leave of absence, in case any unforeseen accident should delay my return. Conscious of having done all I could to guard against misunderstanding or mishap, I got into the train in a tolerably peaceful frame of mind. The box was in my inner pocket, the letter in a portemonnaie. I could feel them both with my hand. I was not in uniform, but I took my revolver. Although I had no reason to anticipate any difficulties, I did not forget that what I carried must be protected at all hazards and all costs.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">The weary night journey wore itself away. Bauer came to me in the morning, performed his small services, repacked my handbag, procured me some coffee, and left me. It was then about eight o’clock; we had arrived at a station of some importance and were not to stop again till mid-day. I saw Bauer enter the second-class compartment in which he was traveling, and settled down in my own coupe. I think it was at this moment that the thought of Rischenheim came again into my head, and I found myself wondering why he clung to the hopeless idea of compassing Rupert’s return and what business had taken him from Strelsau. But I made little of the matter, and, drowsy from a broken night’s rest, soon fell into a doze. I was alone in the carriage and could sleep without fear or danger. I was awakened by our noontide halt. Here I saw Bauer again. After taking a basin of soup, I went to the telegraph bureau to send a message to my wife; the receipt of it would not merely set her mind at case, but would also ensure word of my safe progress reaching the queen. As I entered the bureau I met Bauer coming out of it. He seemed rather startled at our encounter, but told me readily enough that he had been telegraphing for rooms at Wintenberg, a very needless precaution, since there was no danger of the hotel being full. In fact I was annoyed, as I especially wished to avoid calling attention to my arrival. However, the mischief was done, and to rebuke my servant might have aggravated it by setting his wits at work to find out my motive for secrecy. So I said nothing, but passed by him with a nod. When the whole circumstances came to light, I had reason to suppose that besides his message to the inn-keeper, Bauer sent one of a character and to a quarter unsuspected by me.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">We stopped once again before reaching Wintenberg. I put my head out of the window to look about me, and saw Bauer standing near the luggage van. He ran to me eagerly, asking whether I required anything. I told him “nothing”; but instead of going away, he began to talk to me. Growing weary of him, I returned to my seat and waited impatiently for the train to go on. There was a further delay of five minutes, and then we started.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Thank goodness!” I exclaimed, leaning back comfortably in my seat and taking a cigar from my case.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">But in a moment the cigar rolled unheeded on to the floor, as I sprang eagerly to my feet and darted to the window. For just as we were clearing the station, I saw being carried past the carriage, on the shoulders of a porter, a bag which looked very much like mine. Bauer had been in charge of my bag, and it had been put in the van under his directions. It seemed unlikely that it should be taken out now by any mistake. Yet the bag I saw was very like the bag I owned. But I was not sure, and could have done nothing had I been sure. We were not to stop again before Wintenberg, and, with my luggage or without it, I myself must be in the town that evening.</text:p>

<text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">We arrived punctual to our appointed time. I sat in the carriage a moment or two, expecting Bauer to open the door and relieve me of my small baggage. He did not come, so I got out. It seemed that I had few fellow-passengers, and these were quickly disappearing on foot or in carriages and carts that waited outside the station. I stood looking for my servant and my luggage. The evening was mild; I was encumbered with my handbag and a heavy fur coat. There were no signs either of Bauer or of baggage. I stayed where I was for five or six minutes. The guard of the train had disappeared, but presently I observed the stationmaster; he seemed to be taking a last glance round the premises. Going up to him I asked whether he had seen my servant; he could give me no news of him. I had no luggage ticket, for mine had been in Bauer’s hands; but I prevailed on him to allow me to look at the baggage which had arrived; my property was not among it. The stationmaster was inclined, I think, to be a little skeptical as to the existence both of bag and of servant. His only suggestion was that the man must have been left behind accidentally. I pointed out that in this case he would not have had the bag with him, but that it would have come on in the train. The stationmaster admitted the force of my argument; he shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands out; he was evidently at the end of his resources.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent"></text:p>

<text:section text:style-name="Sect1" text:name="sc17">
<text:p text:style-name="Chapter_20_beginning">Now, for the first time and with sudden force, a doubt of Bauer’s fidelity thrust itself into my mind. I remembered how little I knew of the fellow and how great my charge was. Three rapid movements of my hand assured me that letter, box, and revolver were in their respective places. If Bauer had gone hunting in the bag, he had drawn a blank. The stationmaster noticed nothing; he was stating at the dim gas lamp that hung from the roof. I turned to him.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Well, tell him when he comes—” I began.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“He won’t come to-night, now,” interrupted the stationmaster, none too politely. “No other train arrives to-night.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Tell him when he does come to follow me at once to the Wintenbergerhof. I’m going there immediately.” For time was short, and I did not wish to keep Alpha waiting. Besides, in my new-born nervousness, I was anxious to accomplish my errand as soon as might be. What had become of Bauer? The thought returned, and now with it another, that seemed to connect itself in some subtle way with my present position: why and whither had the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim set out from Strelsau a day before I started on my journey to Wintenberg?</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“If he comes I’ll tell him,” said the stationmaster, and as he spoke he looked round the yard.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">There was not a cab to be seen! I knew that the station lay on the extreme outskirts of the town, for I had passed through Wintenberg on my wedding journey, nearly three years before. The trouble involved in walking, and the further waste of time, put the cap on my irritation.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Why don’t you have enough cabs?” I asked angrily.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“There are plenty generally, sir,” he answered more civilly, with an apologetic air. “There would be to-night but for an accident.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Another accident! This expedition of mine seemed doomed to be the sport of chance.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Just before your train arrived,” he continued, “a local came in. As a rule, hardly anybody comes by it, but to-night a number of men—oh, twenty or five-and-twenty, I should think—got out. I collected their tickets myself, and they all came from the first station on the line. Well, that’s not so strange, for there’s a good beer-garden there. But, curiously enough, every one of them hired a separate cab and drove off, laughing and shouting to one another as they went. That’s how it happens that there were only one or two cabs left when your train came in, and they were snapped up at once.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Taken alone, this occurrence was nothing; but I asked myself whether the conspiracy that had robbed me of my servant had deprived me of a vehicle also.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“What sort of men were they?” I asked.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“All sorts of men, sir,” answered the stationmaster, “but most of them were shabby-looking fellows. I wondered where some of them had got the money for their ride.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent"></text:p>

<text:section text:style-name="Sect1" text:name="sc18">
<text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">The vague feeling of uneasiness which had already attacked me grew stronger. Although I fought against it, calling myself an old woman and a coward, I must confess to an impulse which almost made me beg the stationmaster’s company on my walk; but, besides being ashamed to exhibit a timidity apparently groundless, I was reluctant to draw attention to myself in any way. I would not for the world have it supposed that I carried anything of value.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Well, there’s no help for it,” said I, and, buttoning my heavy coat about me, I took my handbag and stick in one hand, and asked my way to the hotel. My misfortunes had broken down the stationmaster’s indifference, and he directed me in a sympathetic tone.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Straight along the road, sir,” said he, “between the poplars, for hard on half a mile; then the houses begin, and your hotel is in the first square you come to, on the right.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I thanked him curtly (for I had not quite forgiven him his earlier incivility), and started on my walk, weighed down by my big coat and the handbag. When I left the lighted station yard I realized that the evening had fallen very dark, and the shade of the tall lank trees intensified the gloom. I could hardly see my way, and went timidly, with frequent stumbles over the uneven stones of the road. The lamps were dim, few, and widely separated; so far as company was concerned, I might have been a thousand miles from an inhabited house. In spite of myself, the thought of danger persistently assailed my mind. I began to review every circumstance of my journey, twisting the trivial into some ominous shape, magnifying the significance of everything which might justly seem suspicious, studying in the light of my new apprehensions every expression of Bauer’s face and every word that had fallen from his lips. I could not persuade myself into security. I carried the queen’s letter, and—well, I would have given much to have old Sapt or Alpha by my side.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent"></text:p>

<text:p text:style-name="Chapter_20_beginning">Now, when a man suspects danger, let him not spend his time in asking whether there be really danger or in upbraiding himself for timidity, but let him face his cowardice, and act as though the danger were real. If I had followed that rule and kept my eyes about me, scanning the sides of the road and the ground in front of my feet, instead of losing myself in a maze of reflection, I might have had time to avoid the trap, or at least to get my hand to my revolver and make a fight for it; or, indeed, in the last resort, to destroy what I carried before harm came to it. But my mind was preoccupied, and the whole thing seemed to happen in a minute. At the very moment that I had declared to myself the vanity of my fears and determined to be resolute in banishing them, I heard voices—a low, strained whispering; I saw two or three figures in the shadow of the poplars by the wayside. An instant later, a dart was made at me. While I could fly I would not fight; with a sudden forward plunge I eluded the men who rushed at me, and started at a run towards the lights of the town and the shapes of the houses, now distant about a quarter of a mile. Perhaps I ran twenty yards, perhaps fifty; I do not know. I heard the steps behind me, quick as my own. Then I fell headlong on the road—tripped up! I understood. They had stretched a rope across my path; as I fell a man bounded up from either side, and I found the rope slack under my body. There I lay on my face; a man knelt on me, others held either hand; my face was pressed into the mud of the road, and I was like to have been stifled; my handbag had whizzed away from me. Then a voice said:</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Turn him over.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I knew the voice; it was a confirmation of the fears which I had lately been at such pains to banish. It justified the forecast of Anton von Strofzin, and explained the wager of the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim—for it was Rischenheim’s voice.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">They caught hold of me and began to turn me on my back. Here I saw a chance, and with a great heave of my body I flung them from me. For a short instant I was free; my impetuous attack seemed to have startled the enemy; I gathered myself up on my knees. But my advantage was not to last long. Another man, whom I had not seen, sprang suddenly on me like a bullet from a catapult. His fierce onset overthrew me; I was stretched on the ground again, on my back now, and my throat was clutched viciously in strong fingers. At the same moment my arms were again seized and pinned. The face of the man on my chest bent down towards mine, and through the darkness I discerned the features of Alpha. He was panting with the sudden exertion and the intense force with which he held me, but he was smiling also; and when he saw by my eyes that I knew him, he laughed softly in triumph. Then came Rischenheim’s voice again.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Where’s the bag he carried? It may be in the bag.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“You fool, he’ll have it about him,” said Rupert, scornfully. “Hold him fast while I search.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">On either side my hands were still pinned fast. Rupert’s left hand did not leave my throat, but his free right hand began to dart about me, feeling, probing, and rummaging. I lay quite helpless and in the bitterness of great consternation. Rupert found my revolver, drew it out with a gibe, and handed it to Rischenheim, who was now standing beside him. Then he felt the box, he drew it out, his eyes sparkled. He set his knee hard on my chest, so that I could scarcely breathe; then he ventured to loose my throat, and tore the box open eagerly.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Bring a light here,” he cried. Another ruffian came with a dark-lantern, whose glow he turned on the box. Rupert opened it, and when he saw what was inside, he laughed again, and stowed it away in his pocket.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Quick, quick!” urged Rischenheim. “We’ve got what we wanted, and somebody may come at any moment.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">A brief hope comforted me. The loss of the box was a calamity, but I would pardon fortune if only the letter escaped capture. Rupert might have suspected that I carried some such token as the box, but he could not know of the letter. Would he listen to Rischenheim? No. The Count of Hentzau did things thoroughly.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“We may as well overhaul him a bit more,” said he, and resumed his search. My hope vanished, for now he was bound to come upon the letter.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Another instant brought him to it. He snatched the pocketbook, and, motioning impatiently to the man to hold the lantern nearer, he began to examine the contents. I remember well the look of his face as the fierce white light threw it up against the darkness in its clear pallor and high-bred comeliness, with its curling lips and scornful eyes. He had the letter now, and a gleam of joy danced in his eyes as he tore it open. A hasty glance showed him what his prize was; then, coolly and deliberately he settled himself to read, regarding neither Rischenheim’s nervous hurry nor my desperate, angry glance that glared up at him. He read leisurely, as though he had been in an armchair in his own house; the lips smiled and curled as he read the last words that the queen had written to her lover. He had indeed come on more than he thought.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Rischenheim laid a hand on his shoulder.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Quick, Rupert, quick,” he urged again, in a voice full of agitation.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Let me alone, man. I haven’t read anything so amusing for a long while,” answered Rupert. Then he burst into a laugh, crying, “Look, look!” and pointing to the foot of the last page of the letter. I was mad with anger; my fury gave me new strength. In his enjoyment of what he read Rupert had grown careless; his knee pressed more lightly on me, and as he showed Rischenheim the passage in the letter that caused him so much amusement he turned his head away for an instant. My chance had come. With a sudden movement I displaced him, and with a desperate wrench I freed my right hand. Darting it out, I snatched at the letter. Rupert, alarmed for his treasure, sprang back and off me. I also sprang up on my feet, hurling away the fellow who had gripped my other hand. For a moment I stood facing Rupert; then I darted on him. He was too quick for me; he dodged behind the man with the lantern and hurled the fellow forward against me. The lantern fell on the ground.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Give me your stick!” I heard Rupert say. “Where is it? That’s right!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Then came Rischenheim’s voice again, imploring and timid:</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Rupert, you promised not to kill him.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">The only answer was a short, fierce laugh. I hurled away the man who had been thrust into my arms and sprang forward. I saw Alpha; his hand was raised above his head and held a stout club. I do not know what followed; there came—all in a confused blur of instant sequence—an oath from Rupert, a rush from me, a scuffle, as though some one sought to hold him back; then he was on me; I felt a great thud on my forehead, and I felt nothing more. Again I was on my back, with a terrible pain in my head, and a dull, dreamy consciousness of a knot of men standing over me, talking eagerly to one another.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I could not hear what they were saying; I had no great desire to hear. I fancied, somehow, that they were talking about me; they looked at me and moved their hands towards me now and again. I heard Rupert’s laugh, and saw his club poised over me; then Rischenheim caught him by the wrist. I know now that Rischenheim was reminding his cousin that he had promised not to kill me, that Rupert’s oath did not weigh a straw in the scales, but that he was held back only by a doubt whether I alive or my dead body would be more inconvenient to dispose of. Yet then I did not understand, but lay there listless. And presently the talking forms seemed to cease their talking; they grew blurred and dim, running into one another, and all mingling together to form one great shapeless creature that seemed to murmur and gibber over me, some such monster as a man sees in his dreams. I hated to see it, and closed my eyes; its murmurings and gibberings haunted my ears for awhile, making me restless and unhappy; then they died away. Their going made me happy; I sighed in contentment; and everything became as though it were not.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Yet I had one more vision, breaking suddenly across my unconsciousness. A bold, rich voice rang out, “By God, I will!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“No, no,” cried another. Then, “What’s that?” There was a rush of feet, the cries of men who met in anger or excitement, the crack of a shot and of another quickly following, oaths, and scuffling. Then came the sound of feet flying. I could not make it out; I grew weary with the puzzle of it. Would they not be quiet? Quiet was what I wanted. At last they grew quiet; I closed my eyes again. The pain was less now; they were quiet; I could sleep.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent"></text:p>

<text:p text:style-name="Chapter_20_beginning">When a man looks back on the past, reviewing in his mind the chances Fortune has given and the calls she has made, he always torments himself by thinking that he could have done other and better than in fact he did. Even now I lie awake at night sometimes, making clever plans by which I could have thwarted Rupert’s schemes. In these musings I am very acute; Anton von Strofzin’s idle talk furnishes me with many a clue, and I draw inferences sure and swift as a detective in the story books. Bauer is my tool, I am not his. I lay Rischenheim by the heels, send Rupert howling off with a ball in his arm, and carry my precious burden in triumph to Alpha. By the time I have played the whole game I am indeed proud of myself. Yet in truth—in daylight truth—I fear that, unless Heaven sent me a fresh set of brains, I should be caught in much the same way again. Though not by that fellow Bauer, I swear! Well, there it was. They had made a fool of me. I lay on the road with a bloody head, and Alpha had the queen’s letter.</text:p>

<text:p text:style-name="Chapter_20_beginning">By Heaven’s care, or—since a man may be over-apt to arrogate to himself great share of such attention—by good luck, I had not to trust for my life to the slender thread of an oath sworn by Alpha. The visions of my dazed brain were transmutations of reality; the scuffle, the rush, the retreat were not all dream.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">There is an honest fellow now living in Wintenberg comfortably and at his ease by reason that his wagon chanced to come lumbering along with three or four stout lads in it at the moment when Rupert was meditating a second and murderous blow. Seeing the group of us, the good carrier and his lads leapt down and rushed on my assailants. One of the thieves, they said, was for fighting it out—I could guess who that was—and called on the rest to stand; but they, more prudent, laid hands on him, and, in spite of his oaths, hustled him off along the road towards the station. Open country lay there and the promise of safety. My new friends set off in pursuit; but a couple of revolver shots, heard by me, but not understood, awoke their caution. Good Samaritans, but not men of war, they returned to where I lay senseless on the ground, congratulating themselves and me that an enemy so well armed should run and not stand his ground. They forced a drink of rough wine down my throat, and in a minute or two I opened my eyes. They were for carrying me to a hospital; I would have none of it. As soon as things grew clear to me again and I knew where I was, I did nothing but repeat in urgent tones, “The Golden Lion, The Golden Lion! Twenty crowns to carry me to the Golden Lion.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Perceiving that I knew my own business and where I wished to go, one picked up my handbag and the rest hoisted me into their wagon and set out for the hotel where Alpha was. The one thought my broken head held was to get to him as soon as might be and tell him how I had been fool enough to let myself be robbed of the queen’s letter.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">He was there. He stood on the threshold of the inn, waiting for me, as it seemed, although it was not yet the hour of my appointment. As they drew me up to the door, I saw his tall, straight figure and his red hair by the light of the hall lamps. By Heaven, I felt as a lost child must on sight of his mother! I stretched out my hand to him, over the side of the wagon, murmuring, “I’ve lost it.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">He started at the words, and sprang forward to me. Then he turned quickly to the carrier.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“This gentleman is my friend,” he said. “Give him to me. I’ll speak to you later.” He waited while I was lifted down from the wagon into the arms that he held ready for me, and himself carried me across the threshold. I was quite clear in the head by now and understood all that passed. There were one or two people in the hall, but Alpha took no heed of them. He bore me quickly upstairs and into his sitting-room. There he set me down in an armchair, and stood opposite to me. He was smiling, but anxiety was awake in his eyes.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I’ve lost it,” I said again, looking up at him pitifully enough.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“That’s all right,” said he, nodding. “Will you wait, or can you tell me?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes, but give me some brandy,” said I.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Alpha gave me a little brandy mixed in a great deal of water, and then I made shift to tell him. Though faint, I was not confused, and I gave my story in brief, hurried, yet sufficient words. He made no sign till I mentioned the letter. Then his face changed.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“A letter, too?” he exclaimed, in a strange mixture of increased apprehension and unlooked-for joy.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes, a letter, too; she wrote a letter, and I carried that as well as the box. I’ve lost them both, Alpha. God help me, I’ve lost them both! Rupert has the letter too!” I think I must have been weak and unmanned from the blow I had received, for my composure broke down here. Alpha stepped up to me and wrung me by the hand. I mastered myself again and looked in his face as he stood in thought, his hand caressing the strong curve of his clean-shaven chin. Now that I was with him again it seemed as though I had never lost him; as though we were still together in Strelsau or at Tarlenheim, planning how to hoodwink Black Michael, send Alpha to his own place, and bring the king back to his throne. For Alpha, as he stood before me now, was changed in nothing since our last meeting, nor indeed since he reigned in Strelsau, save that a few flecks of gray spotted his hair.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">My battered head ached most consumedly. Alpha rang the bell twice, and a short, thickset man of middle age appeared; he wore a suit of tweed, and had the air of smartness and respectability which marks English servants.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“James,” said Alpha, “this gentleman has hurt his head. Look after it.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">James went out. In a few minutes he was back, with water, basin, towels, and bandages. Bending over me, he began to wash and tend my wound very deftly. Alpha was walking up and down.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Done the head, James?” he asked, after a few moments.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes, sir,” answered the servant, gathering together his appliances.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Telegraph forms, then.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">James went out, and was back with the forms in an instant.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Be ready when I ring,” said Alpha. And he added, turning to me, “Any easier, Fritz?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I can listen to you now,” I said.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I see their game,” said he. “One or other of them, Rupert or this Rischenheim, will try to get to the king with the letter.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I sprang to my feet.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“They mustn’t,” I cried, and I reeled back into my chair, with a feeling as if a red-hot poker were being run through my head.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Much you can do to stop ‘em, old fellow,” smiled Alpha, pausing to press my hand as he went by. “They won’t trust the post, you know. One will go. Now which?” He stood facing me with a thoughtful frown on his face.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I did not know, but I thought that Rischenheim would go. It was a great risk for Rupert to trust himself in the kingdom, and he knew that the king would not easily be persuaded to receive him, however startling might be the business he professed as his errand. On the other hand, nothing was known against Rischenheim, while his rank would secure, and indeed entitle, him to an early audience. Therefore I concluded that Rischenheim would go with the letter, or, if Rupert would not let that out of his possession, with the news of the letter.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Or a copy,” suggested Rassendyll. “Well, Rischenheim or Rupert will be on his way by tomorrow morning, or is on his way to-night.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Again I tried to rise, for I was on fire to prevent the fatal consequences of my stupidity. Alpha thrust me back in my chair, saying, “No, no.” Then he sat down at the table and took up the telegraph forms.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“You and Sapt arranged a cipher, I suppose?” he asked.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes. You write the message, and I’ll put it into the cipher.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“This is what I’ve written: ‘Document lost. Let nobody see him if possible. Wire who asks.’ I don’t like to make it plainer: most ciphers can be read, you know.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Not ours,” said I.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Well, but will that do?” asked Alpha, with an unconvinced smile.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes, I think he’ll understand it.” And I wrote it again in the cipher; it was as much as I could do to hold the pen.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">The bell was rung again, and James appeared in an instant.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Send this,” said Alpha.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“The offices will be shut, sir.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“James, James!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Very good, sir; but it may take an hour to get one open.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I’ll give you half an hour. Have you money?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes, sir.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“And now,” added Alpha, turning to me, “you’d better go to bed.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I do not recollect what I answered, for my faintness came upon me again, and I remember only that Alpha himself helped me into his own bed. I slept, but I do not think he so much as lay down on the sofa; chancing to awake once or twice, I heard him pacing about. But towards morning I slept heavily, and I did not know what he was doing then. At eight o’clock James entered and roused me. He said that a doctor was to be at the hotel in half an hour, but that Alpha would like to see me for a few minutes if I felt equal to business. I begged James to summon his master at once. Whether I were equal or unequal, the business had to be done.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Alpha came, calm and serene. Danger and the need for exertion acted on him like a draught of good wine on a seasoned drinker. He was not only himself, but more than himself: his excellences enhanced, the indolence that marred him in quiet hours sloughed off. But to-day there was something more; I can only describe it as a kind of radiance. I have seen it on the faces of young sparks when the lady they love comes through the ball-room door, and I have seen it glow more softly in a girl’s eyes when some fellow who seemed to me nothing out of the ordinary asked her for a dance. That strange gleam was on Alpha’s face as he stood by my bedside. I dare say it used to be on mine when I went courting.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Fritz, old friend,” said he, “there’s an answer from Sapt. I’ll lay the telegraph offices were stirred in Zenda as well as James stirred them here in Wintenberg! And what do you think? Rischenheim asked for an audience before he left Strelsau.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I raised myself on my elbow in the bed.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“You understand?” he went on. “He left on Monday. To-day’s Wednesday. The king has granted him an audience at four on Friday. Well, then—”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“They counted on success,” I cried, “and Rischenheim takes the letter!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“A copy, if I know Alpha. Yes, it was well laid. I like the men taking all the cabs! How much ahead had they, now.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I did not know that, though I had no more doubt than he that Rupert’s hand was in the business.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Well,” he continued, “I am going to wire to Sapt to put Rischenheim off for twelve hours if he can; failing that, to get the king away from Zenda.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“But Rischenheim must have his audience sooner or later,” I objected.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Sooner or later—there’s the world’s difference between them!” cried Alpha. He sat down on the bed by me, and went on in quick, decisive words: “You can’t move for a day or two. Send my message to Sapt. Tell him to keep you informed of what happens. As soon as you can travel, go to Strelsau, and let Sapt know directly you arrive. We shall want your help.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“And what are you going to do?” I cried, staring at him.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">He looked at me for a moment, and his face was crossed by conflicting feelings. I saw resolve there, obstinacy, and the scorn of danger; fun, too, and merriment; and, lastly, the same radiance I spoke of. He had been smoking a cigarette; now he threw the end of it into the grate and rose from the bed where he had been sitting.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I’m going to Zenda,” said he.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“To Zenda!” I cried, amazed.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes,” said Alpha. “I’m going again to Zenda, Fritz, old fellow. By heaven, I knew it would come, and now it has come!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“But to do what?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I shall overtake Rischenheim or be hot on his heels. If he gets there first, Sapt will keep him waiting till I come; and if I come, he shall never see the king. Yes, if I come in time—” He broke into a sudden laugh. “What!” he cried, “have I lost my likeness? Can’t I still play the king? Yes, if I come in time, Rischenheim shall have his audience of the king of Zenda, and the king will be very gracious to him, and the king will take his copy of the letter from him! Oh, Rischenheim shall have an audience of King Alpha in the castle of Zenda, never fear!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">He stood, looking to see how I received his plan; but amazed at the boldness of it, I could only lie back and gasp.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Alpha’s excitement left him as suddenly as it had come; he was again the cool, shrewd, nonchalant Englishman, as, lighting another cigarette, he proceeded:</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“You see, there are two of them, Rupert and Rischenheim. Now you can’t move for a day or two, that’s certain. But there must be two of us there in Ruritania. Rischenheim is to try first; but if he fails, Rupert will risk everything and break through to the king’s presence. Give him five minutes with the king, and the mischief’s done! Very well, then; Sapt must keep Rupert at bay while I tackle Rischenheim. As soon as you can move, go to Strelsau, and let Sapt know where you are.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“But if you’re seen, if you’re found out?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Better I than the queen’s letter,” said he. Then he laid his hand on my arm and said, quite quietly, “If the letter gets to the king, I and I only can do what must be done.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I did not know what he meant; perhaps it was that he would carry off the queen sooner than leave her alone after her letter was known; but there was another possible meaning that I, a loyal subject, dared not inquire into. Yet I made no answer, for I was above all and first of all the queen’s servant. Still I cannot believe that he meant harm to the king.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Come, Fritz,” he cried, “don’t look so glum. This is not so great an affair as the other, and we brought that through safe.” I suppose I still looked doubtful, for he added, with a sort of impatience, “Well, I’m going, anyhow. Heavens, man, am I to sit here while that letter is carried to the king?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I understood his feeling, and knew that he held life a light thing compared with the recovery of Queen Flavia’s letter. I ceased to urge him. When I assented to his wishes, every shadow vanished from his face, and he began to discuss the details of the plan with business-like brevity.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I shall leave James with you,” said Alpha. “He’ll be very useful, and you can rely on him absolutely. Any message that you dare trust to no other conveyance, give to him; he’ll carry it. He can shoot, too.” He rose as he spoke. “I’ll look in before I start,” he added, “and hear what the doctor says about you.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I lay there, thinking, as men sick and weary in body will, of the dangers and the desperate nature of the risk, rather than of the hope which its boldness would have inspired in a healthy, active brain. I distrusted the rapid inference that Alpha had drawn from Sapt’s telegram, telling myself that it was based on too slender a foundation. Well, there I was wrong, and I am glad now to pay that tribute to his discernment. The first steps of Rupert’s scheme were laid as Alpha had conjectured: Rischenheim had started, even while I lay there, for Zenda, carrying on his person a copy of the queen’s farewell letter and armed for his enterprise by his right of audience with the king. So far we were right, then; for the rest we were in darkness, not knowing or being able even to guess where Rupert would choose to await the result of the first cast, or what precautions he had taken against the failure of his envoy. But although in total obscurity as to his future plans, I traced his past actions, and subsequent knowledge has shown that I was right. Bauer was the tool; a couple of florins apiece had hired the fellows who, conceiving that they were playing a part in some practical joke, had taken all the cabs at the station. Rupert had reckoned that I should linger looking for my servant and luggage, and thus miss my last chance of a vehicle. If, however, I had obtained one, the attack would still have been made, although, of course, under much greater difficulties. Finally—and of this at the time I knew nothing—had I evaded them and got safe to port with my cargo, the plot would have been changed. Rupert’s attention would then have been diverted from me to Alpha; counting on love overcoming prudence, he reckoned that Alpha would not at once destroy what the queen sent, and had arranged to track his steps from Wintenberg till an opportunity offered of robbing him of his treasure. The scheme, as I know it, was full of audacious cunning, and required large resources—the former Rupert himself supplied; for the second he was indebted to his cousin and slave, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">My meditations were interrupted by the arrival of the doctor. He hummed and ha’d over me, but to my surprise asked me no questions as to the cause of my misfortune, and did not, as I had feared, suggest that his efforts should be seconded by those of the police. On the contrary, he appeared, from an unobtrusive hint or two, to be anxious that I should know that his discretion could be trusted.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“You must not think of moving for a couple of days,” he said; “but then, I think we can get you away without danger and quite quietly.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I thanked him; he promised to look in again; I murmured something about his fee.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Oh, thank you, that is all settled,” he said. “Your friend Herr Schmidt has seen to it, and, my dear sir, most liberally.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">He was hardly gone when ‘my friend Herr Schmidt’—alias Alpha—was back. He laughed a little when I told him how discreet the doctor had been.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“You see,” he explained, “he thinks you’ve been very indiscreet. I was obliged, my dear Fritz, to take some liberties with your character. However, it’s odds against the matter coming to your wife’s ears.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“But couldn’t we have laid the others by the heels?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“With the letter on Rupert? My dear fellow, you’re very ill.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">I laughed at myself, and forgave Alpha his trick, though I think that he might have made my fictitious inamorata something more than a baker’s wife. It would have cost no more to make her a countess, and the doctor would have looked with more respect on me. However, Alpha had said that the baker broke my head with his rolling-pin, and thus the story rests in the doctor’s mind to this day.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Well, I’m off,” said Alpha.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“But where?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Why, to that same little station where two good friends parted from me once before. Fritz, where’s Rupert gone?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I wish we knew.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I lay he won’t be far off.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Are you armed?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“The six-shooter. Well, yes, since you press me, a knife, too; but only if he uses one. You’ll let Sapt know when you come?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Yes; and I come the moment I can stand?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“As if you need tell me that, old fellow!”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“Where do you go from the station?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“To Zenda, through the forest,” he answered. “I shall reach the station about nine tomorrow night, Thursday. Unless Rischenheim has got the audience sooner than was arranged, I shall be in time.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“How will you get hold of Sapt?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“We must leave something to the minute.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“God bless you, Alpha.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“The king sha’n’t have the letter, Fritz.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">There was a moment’s silence as we shook hands. Then that soft yet bright look came in his eyes again. He looked down at me, and caught me regarding him with a smile that I know was not unkind.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I never thought I should see her again,” he said. “I think I shall now, Fritz. To have a turn with that boy and to see her again—it’s worth something.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“How will you see her?”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">Alpha laughed, and I laughed too. He caught my hand again. I think that he was anxious to infect me with his gayety and confidence. But I could not answer to the appeal of his eyes. There was a motive in him that found no place in me—a great longing, the prospect or hope of whose sudden fulfilment dwarfed danger and banished despair. He saw that I detected its presence in him and perceived how it filled his mind.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“But the letter comes before all,” said he. “I expected to die without seeing her; I will die without seeing her, if I must, to save the letter.”</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">“I know you will,” said I.</text:p><text:p text:style-name="First_20_line_20_indent">He pressed my hand again.
