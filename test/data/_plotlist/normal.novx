      <Desc>
        <p>Applying the pattern as described in "The 1-3-5 Story Structure Made Simple" by Donna Michelle Anderson.</p>

        <Title>The Setup</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>First, establish the normal existence and expectations of your Main Character - but only enough to give context and meaning to the Unexpected Change that is about to occur.</p>
        </Desc>
        <Section id="sc15" />
      </POINT>
      <POINT id="ap2">
        <Title>The Unexpected Change</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>Next, a single event must occur that upsets your Main Character’s expectations and experience of normal life and launches his or her journey.</p>
        </Desc>
        <Section id="sc16" />
      </POINT>
      <POINT id="ap3">
        <Title>The Rejection</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>"I don't want" - No one likes or accepts change in the instant it happens! Your Main Character now must exert the least possible effort to restore life to exactly the way it was before.</p>
        </Desc>
        <Section id="sc17" />

      <POINT id="ap4">
        <Title>The Commitment</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>Your main character eventually accepts that the Unexpected Change is not going to go away and commits to reluctantly struggling through this new life.</p>

      <POINT id="ap5">
        <Title>The Reversal</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>Halfway through your script, your Main Character must fully embrace the Unexpected Change for purely self-serving reasons.</p>
        </Desc>
        <Section id="sc19" />
      </POINT>
      <POINT id="ap6">
        <Title>The Embrace</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>"I DO want" - The Embrace is best seen, not heard.  In a comedy, it is typically a montage to a hot track.  In romance, it is typically a love scene.  In action, it is typically a high-energy action sequence with the Main Character in full control and engagement.  Keep dialogue to a minimum!</p>

        <Title>The Return Of The Main Opponent</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>Now that your Main Character embraces his or her new life, it is time to surprise him or her with a significant obstacle - which is always the Main Opponent with newly heightened powers.</p>

      <POINT id="ap8">
        <Title>The Escalation</Title>

        <Title>The Final Battle</Title>

        </Desc>
        <Section id="sc25" />
      </POINT>
      <POINT id="ap10">
        <Title>The Twist</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>To heighten jeopardy for your Main Character, you may want to add a surprise “reveal” (built on earlier hints) that further challenges, limits or weakens your Main Character during the Final Battle.</p>
        </Desc>
        <Section id="sc23" />

      <POINT id="ap11">
        <Title>Rock Bottom</Title>
        <Desc>

          <p>In the last moment of the Final Battle, give your Main Character precisely the choice he or she had to make after the Unexpected Change, now with far greater consequences.</p>

      <POINT id="ap13">
        <Title>The Sacrifice</Title>
        <Desc>
          <p>"I reluctantly give up" - Your Main Character should choose to reluctantly give up what he or she wants to become a better person and make the world a better place.</p>
